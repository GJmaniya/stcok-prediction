1. app.py: Stock Market Predictor using Streamlit
This Python script creates a stock market prediction web application using Streamlit and a pre-trained Keras model for stock price forecasting. It provides the following functionalities:

Stock Data Retrieval:

The application retrieves historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.
Users can input a stock symbol (default is 'GOOG') and retrieve data for the period from January 2022 to December 2023.
The app displays raw stock data, including open, close, high, low, and adjusted prices for the selected period.
Moving Averages (MA) Visualization:

The app calculates the 50-day (MA50), 100-day (MA100), and 200-day (MA200) moving averages for the stock’s closing price.
It generates three separate plots:
MA50 vs Close Price: Shows how the stock price compares to the 50-day moving average.
MA50, MA100 vs Close Price: Compares the stock’s price with the 50-day and 100-day moving averages.
MA100, MA200 vs Close Price: Compares the stock’s price with the 100-day and 200-day moving averages.
Stock Price Prediction:

The script uses a pre-trained Keras model (Stock Predictions Model.keras) to predict future stock prices based on the last 100 days of closing price data.
The data is normalized using the MinMaxScaler to scale the input between 0 and 1, which is essential for neural network model performance.
After prediction, the results are rescaled to the original range for comparison with actual stock prices.
Comparison of Predicted and Actual Stock Prices:

The app displays a graph comparing the original stock prices with the predicted prices over time.
This allows users to visually assess how closely the model's predictions align with the actual market data.
Tech Stack:

Libraries: yfinance (for data fetching), pandas (data manipulation), numpy (array handling), MinMaxScaler (data normalization), Keras (model prediction), matplotlib (plotting).
Streamlit: Provides a web interface, displaying user input fields, stock data, and interactive plots.
2. pro.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook (Unknown Content)
This Jupyter notebook file likely contains code related to the stock prediction model or further analysis. Typically, notebooks in this context may include:

Data Preprocessing: Loading and cleaning stock data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistics related to stock price trends.
Model Training: Code for training the Keras model used in the app.py. This could include defining a neural network architecture, fitting the model on stock data, and evaluating its performance.
Prediction and Evaluation: Code for predicting future stock prices using the trained model, along with plots comparing predicted prices with actual prices.
If you want a detailed breakdown of the pro.ipynb, you can share specific content or describe its purpose, and I can give a more precise description.
